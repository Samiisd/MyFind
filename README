# My Find

# Description :

myfind is a simplified version of find(1).


# Compilation :

The compilation is done using "make", for now there are 3 rules available :

- all   : Compile the project, building the binary "myfind"

- check : Launch a test suite to find errors.
          If "myfind" is not build yet, it builds it.

- clean : Remove all files created by other rules
